In my 1st programming project, It is expected to perform the game of chance called Tombala (Turkish Bingo) as a C++ console application.

The details of this game played in real life are listed below:
1. Tombala is a game of chance played over 3 sets with at least 2 and at most 5 players.
2. In the Tombala game, each player is given a unique (different) Tombala card with 15 integers on it at the start of the game. These numbers are random numbers in the range of 1 (inclusive) to 90 (inclusive).
3. Each set of the game uses a bag of numbers in the range of 1 (included) and 90 (included). A number is randomly drawn from this bag each time, and each player checks if the number exists on their Tombala card. This process continues similarly until the game set is completed.
4. The first player with 5 numbers on his card is deemed to have made the first “Çinko”, the first player having the card with 10 numbers drawn from the bagmakes the second “Çinko”, and the player with all the numbers on his card drawn from the bag is deemed to have made “Tombala”.
5. The player who makes the first “Çinko” gets 5 points, the player who makes the second “Çinko” gets 10 points, and the player who makes the Tombala gets 15 points.
6. When any player makes Tombala, the game set ends.
7. The player with the highest score after 3 sets of games wins the game.
